## Notes
This game is tested to work with V 0.1.29 b2fee21, but probably can be compiled with a more recent V compiler too.

Update (2022/08/10): it works with V 0.3.0 c752e5e.

Note: a much improved version of this game is available in the main V repository.
See ![2048.v](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/examples/2048/2048.v) .
It has an AI (autosolver) mode, multiple cleaner looks of the tiles.
It can also run on Android and on the ![web](https://v2048.vercel.app/) , unlike this one.
